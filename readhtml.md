 # introduction to HTML
## HTML pages are text documents. 
* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled

* brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.

       * Tags are often referred to as elements.<
        * Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
        * the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
        the end.
       * Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
        about the content of that element.
        * Attributes require a name and a value.</
       To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
        available for you to use, what they do, and where they
        can go

    different parts of a web page and help to describe
    its structure.

 The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure. The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).

 
    Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements

 To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google


DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
        are using.

    You can add comments to your code between the
        <!-- and --> markers.

  The id and class attributes allow you to identify
        particular elements.

The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
        block-level and inline elements together.


<iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
        which other pages can be displayed.
