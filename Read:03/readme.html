<h2>
    introduction to HTML
</h2>
<h5>
    <p>
        <ul> 
            <li>HTML pages are text documents.</li> 
        <li> HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled</li> 
        <li>brackets) to give the information they surround special
        meaning.</li> 

        <li> Tags are often referred to as elements.</li>

        <li> Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes</li>
        <li>the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
        the end.</li>
        <li> Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
        about the content of that element.</li>
        <li>Attributes require a name and a value.</li>
        <li>To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
        available for you to use, what they do, and where they
        can go.</li>
    </ul>

different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure. The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).

<li> 
    Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements
.</li>

<li> To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google
.</li>
